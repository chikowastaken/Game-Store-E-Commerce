## What Did I Learn: 📚

1. **React Routing:** I have sharpened my skills in React routing and gained a deep understanding of how to implement dynamic navigation and page rendering using React Router.

2. **Library Integration:** I have learned how to integrate an external library, Framer Motion, into my project. I've learned how to leverage the library's capabilities to add animations and transitions to UI elements, enhancing the user experience.

3. **Project Organization:** I've learned how to organize and structure the project's folders effectively. Creating separate components, pages, and assets directories helps keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
